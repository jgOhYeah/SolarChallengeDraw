# Notes
- Each car will have at least two races.
- Cars must demonstrate they can move under their own power in the event of a bye.
- If no cars in a race or bye move under their own power, the race will be recorded as DNR (Did Not Run) and all competitors will be considered to have lost the race. In the next round, the car which was meant to compete against the winner of the current race will be awarded a bye. If the current race has a path for the loser to have a second chance, all cars in the race or bye will compete again for this chance in an auxiliary race.
